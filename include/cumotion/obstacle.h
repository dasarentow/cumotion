    //!
    //! The values associated with a `Grid` correspond to the center of each voxel.  The minimal
    //! corner of the minimal voxel in a `Grid` rests at the origin.  I.e., the origin is not at
    //! a voxel center; it is at a voxel corner.
    //!
    //! Voxels in a `Grid` have length `voxel_size` along each axis.
    //!
    //! Grid contains `num_voxels_x` voxels along the X dimension, `num_voxels_y` voxels along the Y
    //! dimension, and `num_voxels_z` voxels along the Z dimension.  This implies that the maximal
