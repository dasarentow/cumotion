  //! Set the value of the parameter.
  //!
  //! `setParam()` returns `true` if the parameter has been successfully updated and `false` if an
  //! error has occurred (e.g., invalid parameter).
  //!
  //! The following parameters can be set for `TrajectoryOptimizer`:
  //!
  //! `enable_self_collision` [`bool`]
  //!   - Enable or disable self-collision avoidance between robot spheres during optimization.
  //!   - When `true`, both inverse kinematics (IK) and trajectory optimization will include
  //!     collision costs to prevent robot spheres from colliding with each other.

  //!     self-intersecting trajectories.
  //!   - Default value is `true` (self-collision avoidance enabled).
  //!
  //! `enable_world_collision` [`bool`]
  //!   - Enable or disable collision avoidance with world obstacles during optimization.
  //!   - When `true`, both IK and trajectory optimization will include collision costs to avoid
  //!     obstacles in the environment.

  //!
  //! `ik/desired_cspace_position_weight` [`double`]

  //!     less than `deviation_limit - activation_distance` will have equal cost. Most solutions
