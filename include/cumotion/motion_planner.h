  //! Set the value of the parameter.
  //!
  //! `setParam` returns `true` if the param has been successfully updated and `false` if an error
  //! has occurred (e.g., invalid parameter).
  //!
  //! The following parameters can be set for `MotionPlanner`:
  //!
  //! `seed` [`int`]
  //!   - Used to initialize random sampling.
  //!   - `seed` must be positive.
  //!   - Default: 1234
  //!
  //! `step_size` [`double`]
  //!   - Step size for tree extension and (optionally) for discretization of `expanded_path` in
  //!     `Results`
  //!   - It is assumed that a straight path connecting two valid c-space configurations with
  //!     separation distance <= `step_size` is a valid edge, where separation distance is defined
  //!     as the L2-norm of the difference between the two configurations.
  //!   - `step_size` must be positive.
  //!   - Default: 0.05
  //!
  //! `max_iterations` [`int`]
  //!   - Maximum number of iterations of tree extensions that will be attempted.
  //!   - If `max_iterations` is reached without finding a valid path, the `Results` will
  //!     indicate `path_found` is `false` and `path` will be an empty vector.
  //!   - `max_iterations` must be positive.
  //!   - Default: 10,000
  //!
  //! `max_sampling` [`int`]
  //!   - Maximum number of configurations used for sampling in the environment setup.
  //!   - `max_sampling` must be positive.
  //!   - Default: 10'000
  //!
  //! `distance_metric_weights` [`std::vector<double>`]
  //!   - When selecting a node for tree extension, the closest node is defined using a weighted,
  //!     squared L2-norm:
  //!       distance = (q0 - q1)^T * W * (q0 - q1)
  //!       where q0 and q1 represent two configurations and W is a diagonal matrix formed from
  //!       `distance_metric_weights`.
  //!   - The length of the `distance_metric_weights` must be equal to the number of c-space
  //!     coordinates for the robot and each weight must be positive.
  //!   - Default: Vectors of ones with length set by the number of c-space coordinates in
  //!     `robot_description`.
  //!
  //! `tool_frame_name` [`std::string`]
  //!   - Indicate the name (from URDF) of the frame to be used for task space planning.
  //!   - With current implementation, setting a `tool_frame_name` that is not found in the
  //!     kinematics will throw an exception rather than failing gracefully.
  //!
  //! `task_space_limits` [`std::vector<Limit>`]
  //!   - Task space limits define a bounding box used for sampling task space when planning
  //!     a path to a task space target.
  //!   - The specified `task_space_limits` vector should be length 3, corresponding to the xyz
  //!     dimensions of the bounding box.
  //!   - Each upper limit must be >= the corresponding lower limit.
  //!   - Default: Lower limits default to -1 and upper limits to 1.
  //!
  //! `enable_cuda_tree` [`bool`]
  //!   - Set to `true` to enable use of CUDA for storing explored configurations and performing
  //!     nearest neighbor look-up, or `false` to disable usage of CUDA.
  //!   - If set to `true` from the `false` state, default values for `cuda_tree_params` will be
  //!     used.
  //!   - If set to `false` from the `true` state, current values for `cuda_tree_params` will be
  //!     discarded (i.e., if returned to `true`, default rather than previous values will be used).
  //!   - NOTE: this parameter does NOT need to be set in the YAML configuration file. The presence
  //!     of a `cuda_tree_params` with corresponding parameters in the configuration file indicates
  //!     that `enable_cuda_tree` should be set to `true`.
  //!   - Default: `true`
  //!
  //! `cuda_tree_params/max_num_nodes` [`int`]
  //!   - Maximum number of valid explored configurations that can be stored in a CUDA tree.
  //!   - A default value of 10000 is recommended for most use-cases.
  //!   - `cuda_tree_params/max_num_nodes` must be positive AND greater than
  //!     `num_nodes_cpu_gpu_crossover`.
  //!   - Default: 10'000
  //!
  //! `cuda_tree_params/max_buffer_size` [`int`]
  //!   - Maximum number of valid configurations that are buffered on CPU prior to transferring to
  //!     GPU.
  //!   - A default value of 30 is recommended for most use-cases.
  //!   - `cuda_tree_params/max_buffer_size` must be positive.
  //!   - Default: 30
  //!
  //! `cuda_tree_params/num_nodes_cpu_gpu_crossover` [`int`]
  //!   - Number of valid explored configurations added to tree prior to copying all configurations
  //!     to GPU and using GPU for nearest neighbor lookup.
  //!   - A default value of 3000 is recommended for most use-cases.
  //!   - `cuda_tree_params/num_nodes_cpu_gpu_crossover` must be positive AND less than
  //!     `max_num_nodes`.
  //!   - Default: 3000
  //!
  //!  NOTE: For all of the `cuda_tree_params` listed above, the best values for optimal performance
  //!        will depend on the number of c-space coordinates, the system hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU,
  //!        and memory configuration), and software versions (e.g., CUDA, NVIDIA GPU driver, and
  //!        cuMotion versions). The provided default recommendations are chosen to be appropriate
  //!        for most expected use-cases.
  //!
  //! `cspace_planning_params/exploration_fraction` [`double`]
  //!   - The c-space planner uses RRT-Connect to try to find a path to a c-space target.
  //!   - RRT-Connect attempts to iteratively extend two trees (one from the initial configuration
  //!     and one from the target configuration) until the two trees can be connected. The
  //!     configuration to which a tree is extended can be either a random sample
  //!     (i.e., exploration) or a node on the tree to which connection is desired
  //!     (i.e., exploitation). The `exploration_fraction` controls the fraction of steps that are
  //!     exploration steps. It is generally recommended to set `exploration_fraction` in range
  //!     [0.5, 1), where 1 corresponds to a single initial exploitation step followed by only
  //!     exploration steps. Values of between [0, 0.5) correspond to more exploitation than
  //!     exploration and are not recommended. If a value outside range [0, 1] is provided, a
  //!     warning is logged and the value is clamped to range [0, 1].
  //!   - A default value of 0.5 is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Default: 0.5
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/translation_target_zone_tolerance` [`double`]
  //!   - A configuration has reached the task space translation target when task space position has
  //!     an L2 Norm within `translation_target_zone_tolerance` of the target.
  //!   - It is assumed that a valid configuration within the target tolerance can be moved directly
  //!     to the target configuration using an inverse kinematics solver and linearly stepping
  //!     towards the solution.
  //!   - In general, it is recommended that the size of the translation target zone be on the same
  //!     order of magnitude as the translational distance in task-space corresponding to moving the
  //!     robot in configuration space by one step with an L2 norm of `step_size`.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 0.05
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/orientation_target_zone_tolerance` [`double`]
  //!   - A configuration has reached the task space pose target when task space orientation is
  //!     within `orientation_target_zone_tolerance` radians and an L2 norm translation
  //!     within `translation_target_zone_tolerance` of the target.
  //!   - It is assumed that a valid configuration within the target tolerances can be moved
  //!     directly to the target configuration using an inverse kinematics solver and linearly
  //!     stepping towards the solution.
  //!   - In general, it is recommended that the size of the orientation target zone be on the same
  //!     order of magnitude as the rotational distance in task-space corresponding to moving the
  //!     robot in configuration space by one step with an L2 norm of `step_size`.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 0.09
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/translation_target_final_tolerance` [`double`]
  //!   - Once a path is found that terminates within `translation_target_zone_tolerance`, an IK
  //!     solver is used to find a configuration space solution corresponding to the task space
  //!     target. This solver terminates when the L2-norm of the corresponding task space position
  //!     is within `translation_target_final_tolerance` of the target.
  //!   - Note: This solver assumes that if a c-space configuration within
  //!     `translation_target_zone_tolerance` is found then this c-space configuration can be
  //!     moved linearly in c-space to the IK solution. If this assumption is NOT met, the returned
  //!     path will not reach the task space target within the `translation_target_final_tolerance`
  //!     and an error is logged.
  //!   - The recommended default value is 1e-4, but in general this value should be set to a
  //!     positive value that is considered "good enough" precision for the specific system.
  //!   - Default: 1e-4
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/orientation_target_final_tolerance` [`double`]
  //!   - For pose targets, once a path is found that terminates within
  //!     `orientation_target_zone_tolerance` and `translation_target_zone_tolerance` of the target,
  //!     an IK solver is used to find a configuration space solution corresponding to the task
  //!     space target. This solver terminates when the L2-norm of the corresponding task space
  //!     position is within `orientation_target_final_tolerance` and
  //!     `translation_target_final_tolerance` of the target.
  //!   - Note: This solver assumes that if a c-space configuration within the target zone
  //!     tolerances is found then this c-space configuration can be moved linearly in c-space to
  //!     the IK solution. If this assumption is NOT met, the returned path will not reach the task
  //!     space target within the final target tolerances and an error is logged.
  //!   - The recommended default value is 1e-4, but in general this value should be set to a
  //!     positive value that is considered "good enough" precision for the specific system.
  //!   - Default: 0.005
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/translation_gradient_weight` [`double`]
  //!   - For pose targets, computed translation and orientation gradients are linearly weighted by
  //!     `translation_gradient_weight` and `orientation_gradient_weight` to compute a combined
  //!     gradient step when using the Jacobian Transpose method to guide tree expansion
  //!     towards a task space target.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 1.0
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/orientation_gradient_weight` [`double`]
  //!   - For pose targets, computed translation and orientation gradients are linearly weighted by
  //!     `translation_gradient_weight` and `orientation_gradient_weight` to compute a combined
  //!     gradient step when using the Jacobian Transpose method to guide tree expansion
  //!     towards a task space target.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 0.125
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/nn_translation_distance_weight` [`double`]
  //!   - For pose targets, nearest neighbor distances are computed by linearly weighting
  //!     translation and orientation distance by `nn_translation_distance_weight` and
  //!     `nn_orientation_distance_weight`.
  //!   - Nearest neighbor search is used to select the node from which the tree of valid
  //!     configurations will be expanded.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 1.0
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/nn_orientation_distance_weight` [`double`]
  //!   - For pose targets, nearest neighbor distances are computed by linearly weighting
  //!     translation and orientation distance by `nn_translation_distance_weight` and
  //!     `nn_orientation_distance_weight`.
  //!   - Nearest neighbor search is used to select the node from which the tree of valid
  //!     configurations will be expanded.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Must be > 0.
  //!   - Default: 0.125
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/task_space_exploitation_fraction` [`double`]
  //!   - Fraction of iterations for which tree is extended towards target position in task space.
  //!   - Must be in range [0, 1]. Additionally, the sum of `task_space_exploitation_fraction` and
  //!     `task_space_exploration_fraction` must be <= 1.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Default: 0.4
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/task_space_exploration_fraction` [`double`]
  //!   - Fraction of iterations for which tree is extended towards random position in task space.
  //!   - Must be in range [0, 1]. Additionally, the sum of `task_space_exploitation_fraction` and
  //!     `task_space_exploration_fraction` must be <= 1.
  //!   - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!     system.
  //!   - Default: 0.1
  //!
  //!  NOTE: The remaining fraction beyond `task_space_exploitation_fraction` and
  //!        `task_space_exploration_fraction` is a `cspace_exploration_fraction` that is
  //!        implicitly defined as:
  //!          1 - (`task_space_exploitation_fraction` + `task_space_exploration_fraction`
  //!        In general, easier path searches will take less time with higher exploitation fraction
  //!        while more difficult searches will waste time if the exploitation fraction is too high
  //!        and benefit from greater combined exploration fraction.
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/max_extension_substeps_away_from_target` [`int`]
  //!  - Maximum number of Jacobian transpose gradient descent substeps that may be taken
  //!    while the end effector is away from the task-space target.
  //!  - The threshold for nearness is determined by the
  //!    `extension_substep_target_region_scale_factor` parameter.
  //!  - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!    system.
  //!  - Must be >= 0.
  //!  - Default: 6
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/max_extension_substeps_near_target` [`int`]
  //!  - Maximum number of Jacobian transpose gradient descent substeps that may be taken
  //!    while the end effector is near the task-space target.
  //!  - The threshold for nearness is determined by the
  //!    `extension_substep_target_region_scale_factor` parameter.
  //!  - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!    system.
  //!  - Must be >= 0.
  //!  - Default: 50
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/extension_substep_target_region_scale_factor` : [`double`]
  //!  - A scale factor used to determine whether the end effector is close enough to the target
  //!    to change the amount of gradient descent substeps allowed when adding a node in RRT.
  //!  - The `max_extension_substeps_near_target` parameter is used when the distance
  //!    (i.e., L2 norm) between the end effector and target position is less than
  //!    `extension_substep_target_region_scale_factor` * `x_zone_target_tolerance`.
  //!  - Must be greater than or equal to 1.0; a value of 1.0 effectively disables the
  //!   `max_extension_substeps_near_target` parameter.
  //!  - The default value is recommended as a starting value for initial testing with a given
  //!    system.
  //!  - Default: 2.0
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/unexploited_nodes_culling_scalar` [`double`]
  //!  - Scalar controlling culling of unexploited nodes during task-space planning.
  //!  - Must be >= 0.0.
  //!  - Default: 1.0
  //!
  //! `task_space_planning_params/gradient_substep_size` [`double`]
  //!  - Size of each gradient-descent substep when following the Jacobian Transpose direction.
  //!  - Must be > 0.0.
  //!  - Default: 0.025
