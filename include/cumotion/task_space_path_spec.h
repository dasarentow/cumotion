//! The `TaskSpacePathSpec` is used to procedurally specify a `TaskSpacePath` from a series of
//! continuous task space segments.
//!
//! Each segment can have position that is:
//!   [1] constant,
//!   [2] linearly interpolated,
//!   [3] or defined by a circular arc.
//! For the case where position follows an arc, the arc can be defined either by a series of three
//! points, or by two endpoints and a constraint that the arc be tangent to the previous segment.
//!
//! Each segment may have orientation that is:
//!   [1] constant (w.r.t. to the fixed global frame),
//!   [2] smoothly blended via spherical linear interpolation (i.e., "slerp"), or
//!   [3] constant w.r.t. the tangent direction of the position path (i.e., "tangent orientation").
//! The "tangent orientation" specification is only relevant for path segments for which position is
//! defined by an arc (since for linear position paths, the "tangent orientation" specification
//! would reduce to a constant orientation w.r.t. the fixed global frame).
