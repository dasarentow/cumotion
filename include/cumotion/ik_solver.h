  // Parameters for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) solver.

  //! best c-space position is less than `bfgs_gradient_norm_termination`.

  //! For the coarse solve, the `bfgs_gradient_norm_termination` is multiplied by the
  //! `bfgs_gradient_norm_termination_coarse_scale_factor` such that the optimization will end

  //! term will always be turned off. Setting to `AUTO` will turn this cost term on for systems
  //! with 7 or more degrees-of-freedom (DoF), while leaving it off for systems with 6 or fewer
  //! DoF. NOTE: DoF is defined as the numer of c-space coordinates upstream from the target frame.
  //!
  //! Setting to `AUTO` is likely to provide desirable results for most common robots. Redundant

  //! Similarly, the size of each penalty region for the second coordinate will be:
  //!   0.1 * (2 - 0) = 0.2

//! Attempt to solve inverse kinematics.
//!
//! A `target_pose` is provided for the task space `target_frame` and the solver attempts to find
//! a corresponding set of c-space coordinates. A valid c-space configuration must not exceed
//! joint limits set in the kinematic structure and must be the target pose tolerances specified
//! within `config`.
//!
//! If the `target_frame` is selected such that some of the c-space coordinates do not affect the
//! pose of the target frame, these "downstream" coordinates will be ignored by the IK solver. For
//! the case where the successful descent was started from a seed provided in `config.cspace_seeds`,
//! the "downstream" coordinates will not be altered from the provided seed. For the case where
//! a random seed is used, the "downstream" coordinates will be returned with values between their
//! respective c-space position limits. This behavior is intended to support cases such as branched
//! kinematic structures (i.e., to solve for palm pose of a robotic system with an arm and multiple
//! fingers) or a redundant serial linkage for which it is desired to set a pose of a frame not
//! rigidly fixed to the end effector.
//!
//! This implementation of cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) is based on "A Combined Optimization
//! Method for Solving the Inverse Kinematics Problem of Mechanical Manipulators" (1991) by
//! Wang et al.
//! Ref: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/788/Sp06/ReferenceMaterial/IK/WC91.pdf
//!
//! As described by Wang et al., this "combined" method uses cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) as a
//! quick method to find a feasible c-space position that is in the neighborhood of an exact
//! solution to the inverse kinematics problem. These nearby c-space positions are then used to
//! "warm start" the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. Given a point sufficiently
//! near an exact solution, the BFGS algorithm is able to leverage an estimate of curvature to
//! rapidly converge to a very accurate approximation of the exact solution.
//!
